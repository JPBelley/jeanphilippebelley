          <p>I've worked as a web developer for over a year now. In addition to my love for
            web development, I have a strong passion for entrepreneurship. This interest
            led me to co-found Digital Entrepreneurs with Pierre Fortin in 2015. This
            project has been our real-world university where we have learned from speakers
            with incredible expertise in online industries, both in Montreal and internationally.
            My projects are always driven by the desire to find meaning in our work and to keep a
            balance between work and life so that our dreams do not die. You can follow another
            passion of mine on Soundcloud.
